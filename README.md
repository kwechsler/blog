# [Personal Blog](http://www.keithwechsler.com) Generator

This respository is the code used to generate my personal blog.  I have been wanting to create a blog for some time, but I was hesitant to setup one in a standard CMS like WordPress because I didn't want to have to deal with maintaining the server and keeping it from being hacked.  My next thought was that I would use SquareSpace or Weebly, but I wanted to have more direct control over the site and my posts.  I came across Jekyll and saw where it could be hosted on GitHub and have a custom domain name associated with it.  I wanted to use a JavaScript-based system, instead of Ruby, so I moved to [Hexo](http://www.hexo.io).

## What I Hope to Accomplish

* Become my diligent about writing - both computer code and text for human consumption
* Learn some new technologies - Git, GitHub, JavaScript, Node, Hexo
* Have an easily accessible spot that I can capture documentation for things I learn
* Allow others to see what I've been up to
